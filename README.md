This is where the app will live. 

I think this is how we should handle things:

I'm going to put an empty android project on master for now. If you're modifying any of it, make sure to fork it and work on it seperately. Before merging it back to master, test it and get everyone else to test it for any bugs, and once everyone says it's ok, then we can merge it with master.
