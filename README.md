The backend logic of our app is fully functional. We have notification and app blocking correctly implemented. We have many user checks to ensure our app is using correctly, such as ensuring users have given our app permission to block apps and notifications and being unable to create empty profiles, etc. We have a well thought-out and produced UI. However, we did struggle with connecting the timer or the schedule to our backend, so functionality for blocking apps during a timer and schedule is not fully completed as of this cycle. Please use our app with the Pixel api 23, as we know this emulator is compatible with our code.
